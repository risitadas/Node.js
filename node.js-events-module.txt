Events in Node.js :

built-in module, called "Events",
where we can create-, fire-, and listen for- our own events.

very useful for real time event driven applications



to include the built-in Events module, 
	we use the require() method


all event properties and methods are an instance of an EventEmitter object,
to access these properties and methods, we create an EventEmitter object :

	const events = require('events');
	const eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();


to fire an event,
	we use the emit() method


events-module.js

const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter {}
const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', () => {
   console.log('an event occurred!');
});

myEmitter.emit('event');
